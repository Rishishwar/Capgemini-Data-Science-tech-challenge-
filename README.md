# Capgemini-Data-Science-tech-challenge-
This is a Data Science Challenge organized by Capgemini. 


In this project, we have to predict the demand of the employees for the next two month by considering a lot of factors like
location Skillset experience and other factors. So HR team can fulfill the demand of the employees. We have to consider our maximum 
number of the employee should be billable. if they are not then it is a loss to the company. 
so we have to minimize the number of demand by using the fullest current employee resource.
